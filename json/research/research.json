      "content": "This research leverages Non-VR immersive technology and narrative-driven visualizations to effectively present cyberbullying data. By employing data-driven designs, the platform layers and categorizes various forms of bullying (verbal, physical, cyberbullying) and user responses, helping audiences better understand the information. The integration of real-life hybrid physical and digital experiences with data-driven content enhances the immersive experience, allowing users to make informed choices and explore different outcomes. Interactive sound and motion elements further engage users, fostering a deeper connection with the narratives.",
      "abstract": "The research focuses on utilizing Non-VR immersive technology to explore how narrative-driven visualizations can effectively present cyberbullying data. The platform emphasizes data-driven designs, where layered data grouping and categorization illustrate the interactions between different forms of bullying (verbal, physical, cyberbullying), user responses, and behavior changes. Users engage with the platform through innovative data-driven designs, seamlessly integrated with narrative-driven technologies, aiming to explore how data can be more effectively communicated and understood by audiences. This approach enables users to dynamically explore how each form of bullying is represented, ensuring that the audience more effectively understands and absorbs the information through intuitive and engaging data visualizations. <br>The project integrates real-life hybrid physical and digital experiences with data-driven content, enriching the narrative visualization experience. By allowing users to make data-driven choices, the platform enables them to explore different outcomes and scenarios, fostering a deeper connection with the content. Sound and motion elements further enhance the immersive experience, responding to user interactions and deepening their engagement with the narratives presented. <br><br>",

These ESL (English as a Second Language) scholars face specific challenges in effectively contributing to and understanding discussions.

    "abstract": "Narrative visualization has become a crucial tool in data presentation, merging storytelling with data visualization to convey complex information in an engaging and accessible manner. In this study, we review the design space for narrative visualizations, focusing on animation style, through a comprehensive analysis of 80 papers from key visualization venues. We categorize these papers into six broad themes: Animation Style, Interactivity, Technology Usage, Methodology Development, Evaluation Type, and Application Domain. Our findings reveal a significant evolution in the field, marked by a growing preference for animated and non-interactive techniques. This trend reflects a shift towards minimizing user interaction while enhancing the clarity and impact of data presentation. We also identified key trends and technologies shaping the field, highlighting the role of technologies, such as machine learn- ing in driving these changes. We offer insights into the dynamic interrelations within the narrative visualization domains, and suggest future research directions, including exploring non-interactive techniques, examining the interplay between different visualization elements, and developing domain-specific visualizations.<br><br>",
