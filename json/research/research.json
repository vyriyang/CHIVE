      "content": "This research leverages Non-VR immersive technology and narrative-driven visualizations to effectively present cyberbullying data. By employing data-driven designs, the platform layers and categorizes various forms of bullying (verbal, physical, cyberbullying) and user responses, helping audiences better understand the information. The integration of real-life hybrid physical and digital experiences with data-driven content enhances the immersive experience, allowing users to make informed choices and explore different outcomes. Interactive sound and motion elements further engage users, fostering a deeper connection with the narratives.",
      "abstract": "The research focuses on utilizing Non-VR immersive technology to explore how narrative-driven visualizations can effectively present cyberbullying data. The platform emphasizes data-driven designs, where layered data grouping and categorization illustrate the interactions between different forms of bullying (verbal, physical, cyberbullying), user responses, and behavior changes. Users engage with the platform through innovative data-driven designs, seamlessly integrated with narrative-driven technologies, aiming to explore how data can be more effectively communicated and understood by audiences. This approach enables users to dynamically explore how each form of bullying is represented, ensuring that the audience more effectively understands and absorbs the information through intuitive and engaging data visualizations. <br><br>The project integrates real-life hybrid physical and digital experiences with data-driven content, enriching the narrative visualization experience. By allowing users to make data-driven choices, the platform enables them to explore different outcomes and scenarios, fostering a deeper connection with the content. Sound and motion elements further enhance the immersive experience, responding to user interactions and deepening their engagement with the narratives presented. <br><br>",

        "abstract": "Like any other population, signers have dialects, show variations, allow regional modifications, and is bound and limited by the user’s choice of signs, speed of hands and experience. An effective and ideal ASL communication is possible when two signers with equal experience and have similar regional dialects converse. However, ideal scenarios exist to remind us that they are not always real. <br><br>We explore communication needs and conversational challenges of signers and non-signers by conducting a cross-sectional study between the two populations. Our exclusive qualitative analysis reveals that while the D/deaf community utilizes technology for communication, challenges including limited translation accuracy, higher costs, and a lack of learning options persist. Additionally, varied proficiency levels, regional dialects, and the lack of visual cues further complicate interactions. Our study identifies key barriers and design approaches that emphasize inclusivity, adaptability, and usability.",

These ESL (English as a Second Language) scholars face specific challenges in effectively contributing to and understanding discussions. Through extensive literature review and need-finding surveys, we identified these obstacles, and the functionalities ESLs are looking for in collaborative tools. <br><br>This led to the creation of LINC, an application designed to support efficient, multilingual collaboration during research meetings.

    "abstract": "Narrative visualization has become a crucial tool in data presentation, merging storytelling with data visualization to convey complex information in an engaging and accessible manner. In this study, we review the design space for narrative visualizations, focusing on animation style, through a comprehensive analysis of 80 papers from key visualization venues. We categorize these papers into six broad themes: Animation Style, Interactivity, Technology Usage, Methodology Development, Evaluation Type, and Application Domain. Our findings reveal a significant evolution in the field, marked by a growing preference for animated and non-interactive techniques. This trend reflects a shift towards minimizing user interaction while enhancing the clarity and impact of data presentation. We also identified key trends and technologies shaping the field, highlighting the role of technologies, such as machine learn- ing in driving these changes. We offer insights into the dynamic interrelations within the narrative visualization domains, and suggest future research directions, including exploring non-interactive techniques, examining the interplay between different visualization elements, and developing domain-specific visualizations.<br><br>",

    "content": "Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.",
    "abstract": "Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of 'de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum' (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular during the Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum, 'Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..', comes from a line in section 1.10.32.<br><br>The standard chunk of Lorem Ipsum used since the 1500s is reproduced below for those interested. Sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 from 'de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum' by Cicero are also reproduced in their exact original form, accompanied by English versions from the 1914 translation by H. Rackham.<br><br>",
